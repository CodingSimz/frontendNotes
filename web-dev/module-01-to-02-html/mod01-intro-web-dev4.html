	  <h1>Software Development</h1>
		<p>Software Development Strategies can be applied to any type of development process or project</p>
		<p>Software Development Life Cyle - used to be simpler because the tech and Users had simpler demands but today its more complex so Design is more important than ever!</p>
		<p>3 Methods of the SDLC are RAD, Waterfall and Inerative.</p>
		
		<p><em>The Key to Software Development is to have as much upfront information as possible</em>.</p> 
		<p>Remeber different tasks and projects require different methodologies and resources - Software Development Life Cycle templates are often are great place to start.</p>

	<div class="w3-third">
		<h2>RAD</h2>
		<p>Rapid Application Development - functional but not very detailed.</p>
		<p>Take requirements, develop, QA and then deploy.</p>
		<h2>Waterfall</h2>
		<p>Gather requirements, analysis, design, development, QA, Deployment</p>
		<p>Issue with this method is that it implies version one is perfect,</p>

  <div class="w3-third">
		<p> <strong> -^__^- </strong> <br></p>
		<h2>Interative</h2>
		<p>Ever-evolving = repeating the cycle for each version.</p>
		<p>Also known as the Spiral Model.</p>
		<ol start="0">
			<li>Initial Planning Phase - sometimes abstract ideas<br>faster checkout</li>
			<li>Tech, money, time, resources involved<br></li>
			<li>Requirements Analysis: more detailed breakdown of above and determine of Best Method to reach goals</li>
			<li>Design and initial development</li>
			<li>Implementation: platform (web, mobile etc)</li>
			<li>Testing - both manual and automated - performance, usability, integrity</li>
			<li>Evaluation UAT User Acceptance Testing</li>
			<li>User Sign-off: did we deliver?</li>
			<li>Support Cycle - how will you maintain from this point forward?</li>
